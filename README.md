# Bankruptcy Prediction with Logistic Regression

![Bankruptcy Prediction](bankruptcy.jpg)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset for predicting bankruptcy in United States banks from 2008 to 2017 using logistic regression. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the probability of bankruptcy for banks in the United States, focusing on the period from 2008 to 2017. We employ logistic regression, a popular machine learning technique for binary classification, to make these predictions. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle.

## Files in this Repository

1. **`Lodit bankruptcy-col.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the bankruptcy prediction using logistic regression. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

2. **`Bancarrota.finalll.csv`**: The dataset used in the Jupyter Notebook. It contains various financial and economic indicators for the banks.

## Dataset

The dataset (`bankruptcy_data.csv`) contains financial and economic indicators relevant to banks in the United States. These indicators are used to train a logistic regression model for bankruptcy prediction.

## Dependencies

Ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed in your environment before running the Jupyter Notebook:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
 ```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
